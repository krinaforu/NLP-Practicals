            "text": "It depends on how you like your tea !\n\nTo make your own perfect cup of tea, you\u2019ll need:\n\n * loose leaf tea\n * a porcelain cup\n * a thermometer\n * a teapot\n * a teacosy\nChoosing Your Tea\n\nThe first thing to determine about your tea is the kind of tea you want \u2013 green tea, white tea, black tea or oolong tea? Best way to do is to go by seasons. Like every other agricultural product, there are certain seasons more suitable than others for drinking various teas. Each tea growing region has different seasons in which it harvests tea leaves, and they cannot be plucked until the weather is suitable and the plants are fully grown.\n\nFor example, producers in India and Nepal begin plucking black tea in early March (first flush) and at the end of spring, usually in May tea producers in East Asia start the production of black tea after the production of white and green tea is already complete. So, choosing your tea keeping in mind the season it is best served in, is a smart choice to make.\n\nGET THE RIGHT WATER TEMPERATURE\n\nThe temperature of the water is really important, depending on which tea you\u2019ll be drinking. Ideally stop the kettle before it reaches the rolling boil- when the small bubbles form along the sides of the kettle. Alternatively the warm cup brewing method is an excellent way to cool the water\n\nIf you are a real sticker and want to get it exactly right white and green teas are best at 70\u00b0c.\n\n * For black and oolong teas use water around 85\u00b0c.\n * For herbal infusions use 100\u00b0c water, and 90\u00b0c for Chamomile.\n * There are some excellent temperature controlled kettles out available.\nTea needs oxygen, so don\u2019t re-boil water as this takes a lot of the oxygen out and will leave your tea tasting a bit. It is essential that the tea leaves are not left to stew once they have been brewed to the desired strength.\n\nStraining the tea completely between infusions will prevent the leaves from becoming bitter. Once your kettle has boiled, pour the water into your teapot, then add your thermometer to check when the water has cooled to the appropriate temperature.\n\nCHECK THE BREWING TIME\n\nThe time you leave the tea in the pot depends on the type of tea, so make sure you look for steeping instructions \u2013 most good-quality teas will tell you how long they need on the packet.\n\nRegardless of whether you perform Japanese Tea ceremony or prepare the finest Chinese cup, the general process of brewing tea is more or less the same.\n\nYour cup of tea can be ready in five simple steps.\n\nWarming Vessels: Warming the steeping as well as the drinking vessels will make sure that the temperature does not significantly decrease when you pour the water into the brewing vessel or tea into the drinking vessel\n\n * Adding leaves: Adding leaves to your vessel before adding water to it is an important step that we must keep in mind to maintain the flavours of tea. In doing so, one may use their hands, a spoon or anything of your choice.\n * Blanching: Blanching is nothing but pouring water on your leaves and then quickly pouring it out. The process is mainly done to allow the leaves to unroll and maximize infusion. The poured out water must then be poured into the drinking water to keep them warm and make them smell like the tea being prepared.\n * Steeping: Pour hot water on blanched leaves to begin the steeping process. A thing to keep in mind is that if you are steeping the leaves in a container with a top, you need to pour hot water on the outside of the vessel to keep it warm and maintain the temperature.\n * Decanting: After the steeping process, pouring the tea into another container will make sure that the liquor is homogenous.\nCAREFULLY ADD YOUR MILK\n\nNow it\u2019s time to add the milk. It\u2019s only usually black teas that you add milk to, but be careful \u2013 too much calcium can cause a scum to form on the top of your drink. This can also come from hard water. If you live in a hard water area and really want to make the absolute perfect cup of tea, boil mineral water instead of tap water. Stirring usually gets rid of calcium too, but it\u2019s a nicer experience just not to have it.\n\nWhite and green teas [ https://goo.gl/XnSkuq ] are so delicate and naturally sweet that you won\u2019t need to add sugar or milk. With black tea [ https://goo.gl/rHZxVF ] anything goes. We only sell the best leaf teas - and they do not need anything but it\u2019s entirely a matter of taste.\n\nSIT BACK AND RELAX\n\nFinally, it\u2019s time to relax. So sit back on your sofa and drink your perfectly brewed tea! If you want to try premium quality of Indian teas from the highest quality you can purchase it from an online tea shop called Teafloor [ https://goo.gl/AeT2Vs ], they have wide varities of flavoured teas available. I have personally tried it.",

            "text": "First: There is no such thing as the perfect tea. There is only such a thing as \"right technique\" to make a perfect cup. \n\nThe right technique now, depends on the kind of tea you have - loose-leaf or CTC grains. Loose-leaf teas require patience and care in terms of quantity of leaves to be used, temperature of water and steeping time. CTC grains aren't as complex as loose-leaf tea, ideal only for milky teas and chai, and hence can be treated more leniently. \n\nLet's talk about making loose leaf teas. \n\nI am not a stickler for tea paraphernalia and rituals, because I believe you can make a good cup of tea with just hot water, good leaves and simple enough cup. But I do pay attention to the quantity of leaves I choose for my cup, the temperature of water for steeping the leaves and the steep time. Paying attention to these three is the least you ought to do to make a \"perfect\" cup. \n\n1. Choose fresh tea leaves. By fresh I mean leaves that have only recently been processed, from a recent season. Tea is harvested thrice in most parts of the world, typically during spring, summer and autumn. And seasonality affects the flavor of the tea a lot. So, every season, you can expect different tasting tea, even if it's from the same tea growing region. \n\nFreshness matters because tea is an agricultural product at the end of the day. So, when you drink fresh (a tea that is no more than a year old), the tea tastes more delicious and is better for you. \n\nTip: Check for the tea's plucking date (if possible) with your tea atelier. This way you know how old the tea is. \n\n2. Choose spring water or regular tap water. Minerality has a strong affect on how a tea tastes. Never make tea using bottled mineral water. There are just too many minerals in it and they overpower the natural flavors of the tea. Also, avoid water with too much chlorine . Spring water makes the most delicious cup of tea, but tap water will do just as well. \n\n3. Opt for porcelain/ceramic ware. Not that you cannot use cups made of other materials, it's just that porcelain/ceramic tea ware have better heat retention properties and you can gauge the color of the liquor better. Avoid plastic serve ware, or at least use a BPA-free plastic. \n\nMaking a perfect cup. \n\nThis is something I picked up during my travels to tea estates in Darjeeling.\n\n1. For 150-180ml of water, use about 2.5gms of tea. That's about one big spoonful of tea leaves for a glass of water. \n\n2. Temperature prescriptions: \n\nFor white tea: 80 - 85 degree Celsius\n\nFor green tea: same\n\nFor oolong tea: same or maximum 90 degree Celsius\n\nFor black: anywhere between 90 and 95 degree Celsius  (or just before water hits a rolling boil)\n\nTip: Never use roiling boiling water for making tea. Because of the high temperature, you run the risk of \"cooking\" the leaves, destroying much of their delicate flavors. \n\nThumb rule to follow:  A lighter tea requires more temperate water, a stronger tea can use a water that's just \"off the boil\" \n\n3. Add tea to a cup. It is advisable to pre-heat the cup by tossing in some hot water and discarding it after a few swirls. \n\n4. Pour heated water over the leaves, cover the cup with a lid and allow the leaves to steep. \n\nIdeally (and this is  a thumb rule I personally follow), you need more time to steep a light tea than a strong one. I usually steep white and green teas for about 5 min. This allows the flavors to get extracted properly. Oolongs are more temperamental. So I test the cup after 3 minutes, and once every minute after that, to check if the taste feels right. And for blacks, I give the leaves no more than 3 minutes. \n\nTip: You know you have ruined a cup if a tea tastes bitter. This means you have \"over-steeped\" the tea, allowing tannins (the bitter tasting compound in tea) to take over all the good tea flavors. \n\n5. Once the tea tastes as desired, discard the leaves. This was you avoid running the risk of over steeping the leaves. \n\nNote: There is no ideal taste of tea. Ideal is what appeals to your tastes. So, if in doubt, test a little. Eventually, you'll figure out what works for you. \n\nTip: For a strong cup, use more leaves than longer steeping time. The longer you steep, the more you allow tannins to seep into your cup. ",

            "text": "Ultimately it all depends in preference. Do you like you cuppa to be strongly flavored or lightly flavored? Do you like green, oolong, black, or pu-erh (Chinese fermented-leaf tea)? Also, do you drink the tea by itself or do you add flavorings such a sugar and milk? The world of tea is a big one! Experiment to find what suits you best, but a few guidelines can point you in the right direction.\n\n(The below text was written in bold by the author for emphasis.)\n\nHere are the basics. There are three parameters to watch when making tea. Leaf amount, water temperature, and steeping time. (A fourth one can be considered the vessel in which the tea is brewed, but for simplicity\u2019s sake I will assume that a porcelain teapot or gaiwan is being used here.) An increase in any of these will result in a stronger flavor, while a decrease in one or more parameters will result in a smoother flavor. For example, if you increase only leaf amount, but leave water temperature and steeping time unchanged, you will get a stronger flavor in your tea. If you use a slightly larger than usual amount of leaf, but steep for a long time at relatively low temperature, the tea is likely to be very flavorful, but lack astringency or bitterness. Usually, experimenting with the leaf amount will change the flavor, but brewing your perfect cup of tea will require you to experiment will all 3 parameters until you get what you want.\n\nPersonally, I drink green tea, though I sometimes drink oolong and black teas as well. Tea made from loose leaf is usually more economical than that made from teabags, as you can steep the leaves multiple times, at least when you brew East Asian style. English and other Western tea-drinking traditions usually call for black tea that is steeped for several minutes, resulting in a strong brew that can be either dliuted with some hot water to taste, flavored with milk and sugar or other sweetener, or flavored with lemon juice or other fruit-derived flavoring. Green tea is a relatively new thing in Western countries.\n\nEnglish-style black tea is simple enough. Just get freshly boiled water, pour it on the leaves, and let steep for 2\u20135 minutes. Drink by itself (not the usual custom in the UK) or add milk and sugar. In China black tea is usually drunk straight and the leaves steeped multiple times, with no flavorings. Keemun and Lapsang Souchong are two Chinese-style black teas.\n\nGreen teas can be particularly troublesome for Western consumers, so here is some info than can help. For Japanese green teas such as sencha, the water temperature should be 60\u201380\u00baC (165\u2013180\u00baF) and leaves can be steeped three times. First time is 60 seconds, 2nd time is 30 seconds and 3rd time is 10\u201315 seconds. For a stronger brew, increase leaf amount, water temperature, or steeping time. For a weaker brew, reduce leaf amount, reduce water temperature, or shorten steeping time. Gyokuro is brewed with water at 50\u00baC (140\u00baF) and leaves are steeped for 2 minutes the first time, 20 seconds the 2nd time, 1 minute the 3rd time, and 2 minutes the 4th time. The 3rd and 4th times the water is hotter (80\u201390\u00baC) to extract the last bit of flavor. Some sencha, such as Uji (Kyoto) style and Shizuoka organic, are steeped as follows. First steep is 75\u201390 seconds, 2nd steep is 20 seconds, and 3rd steep is 5\u201310 seconds. Fukamushi sencha, currently the most widely drunk green tea in Japan, is flavorful and very easy to prepare. Use 2\u20133 grams per 150 mL of water and brew at water temperature of 60\u201370\u00baC (160\u2013175\u00baF), though it is better to brew at 60\u00baC since the small leaf particle size means the tea will brew quickly, which also means that the brewing time will be short. 1st steep is 30\u201345 seconds, 2nd steep is 20 seconds, and 3rd steep is 10 seconds.\n\nChinese green teas are varied and their brewing methods are also varied, but generally the same method used for Japanese green teas apply to Chinese greens. Some are even brewed \u201cgong fu\u201d style. This is the preferred brewing method for Chinese oolong and black teas. (See video at bottom of page for more.)\n\nA picture is worth 1000 words, they say. Thus, I submit for your review some videos on how to make green tea. This one is on how to make a cup of Maofeng, a Chinese green tea.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuahJCcdbh4\nAnd a general tutorial on brewing sencha (Japanese green tea):\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZktZ1LJroc\nFinally, a short video on gong-fu style tea service:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QhYD4IhtIJ0\nThe video is 13 minutes long, but the host explains how to care for tea utensils as well as demonstrate the gong fu tea method.\n\nSorry if I could not furnish more information. I hope you will find this rather long mini-tutorial to be most useful.",

            "text": "How is Tea Made?\n\nWe've broken down the process from harvest to production so you can understand how tea leaves get from rolling green hillsides to your piping hot cup. For the purpose of simplicity and accuracy, this guide focuses on the two methods of production for true teas. Read on to learn how tea is made and learn about the process that takes leaves from the same plant and turns them into incredibly different flavors and aromas.\n\nCultivation of Tea Plants\n\nThe first stage of tea production is the cultivation of the tea plant. The Camellia sinensis plant is an evergreen bush that thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. This plant prefers acidic soil and a significant amount of rainfall for the best growing conditions. Grown as far north as England and as far south as New Zealand, the tea plant is cultivated all across the world. Tea plants grown at higher altitudes tend to have a more potent flavor.\n\nIn general, it takes about three years before a tea plant produces leaves suitable for tea making. Tea plants are categorized into three different groups based on their size (1). Assam leaves are the largest, followed by Cambodian, which are medium sized and China type leaves, which are the smallest. While the tea plant can grow up to 50 feet tall, most plants for tea harvesting are kept to waist height in order to make it easier to pluck the young, fresh leaves at the top of the plant. Shorter plants also tend to produce more shoots and leaves, thus increasing production capacity\n\nHarvest of Tea Leaves\n\nTea leaves are harvested from the tea plant and then transported to a nearby tea factory for production. During the harvest, leaves are only plucked from the top one to two inches of the tea plant. Known as flushes, these tea leaves are produced every 7 to 15 days during harvest season (1).\n\nTea leaves are generally hand-plucked from the tea garden or tea plantation and placed into large wicker baskets. Once a basket is full, it is brought to a tea master where leaves are inspected and weighed to ensure quality. Broken leaves are typically discarded as are ones that shown signs of sun or water damage. For every 100 kilograms of fresh tea leaves, only about 25 kilograms are sent on to the next tea production step (2).\n\nDuring the Harvest and sorting stage, tea leaves are examined based on size, type and appearance. In many countries, tea leaves are classified based on the region in which they were cultivated as well as the methods used for harvesting. Each individual tea leaf is also inspected and sorted into white, green, black, pu-erh and oolong categories for the next processing step.\n\nOrthodox Method\n\nFor the orthodox method, tea leaves are subjected to a 4-step process that includes withering, rolling, oxidation and drying. During the production, each step helps to produce the flavor profiles associated with darker true teas.\n\nWithering\n\nTea leaves are transported from the fields to the tea factory within hours after plucking and sorting. Leaves destined to become black or oolong teas are withered in order to reduce moisture content so that leaves can be rolled without flaking. Harvested tea leaves typically have a high water content\u2014around 75%\u2014which is reduced to about 45% for rolling and oxidation. The water content is removed by laying leaves on a flat mesh surface or a bamboo tray. During the drying process, the leaves are subjected to cool air, for anywhere from 8 to 18 hours.\n\nRolling\n\nOnce the leaves are withered, they are rolled in order to promote oxidation. In traditional production methods, leaves are hand rolled although in modern times, many manufacturers use rolling machines to expedite the process. As the withered leaves are rolled, internal cell structures are broken down, releasing essential oils that react with oxygen to develop flavor and aroma.\n\n",

            "text": "While the method of brewing is certainly important, far more important are the ingredients used to make the tea.\n\nFor starters, because tea is mostly water, using good water in the brew can have a huge impact. If your tap water tastes of chlorine or some other chemical, using filtered or bottled water will improve the tea significantly. Ensuring the water is freshly drawn also makes a difference. Much of the flavor in tea \u2014 or any food for that matter \u2014 is detected using your sense of smell. Water that has been sitting around for 24 hours will have fewer dissolved gasses that bring tea's interesting aromatic notes up to your olfactory system.\n\nLikewise, using a good tea makes an big difference. As a guideline, loose, whole leaf teas will make a better brew than the powder or fannings found in most tea bags. Using a loose tea also gives the leaves more room to expand in the pot.\n\nAs for the particulars of brewing, the other contributors are spot on. No bona fide tea \u2014 that is something derived from the camellia sinensis plant \u2014 should be brewed with boiling water. Generally speaking, green teas should be brewed with cooler water than oolong teas, which should, in turn, be brewed at lower temperatures than black teas. As for brewing time, three to four minutes works well as a general rule. In my experience, the bigger problem is people forgetting to remove the tea leaves or pour all the brewed tea after the three to four minute mark.\n\nWhether to add milk, sugar or other accompaniments is more of a matter of taste in my mind. At least for me, milk does not work in green teas. The earthy, vegetal notes do not play well with the dairy. I do like black and oolong teas with a splash of milk.",

Fill your kettle: Use fresh tap water, the oxygen in the water is really important to creating a good cuppa because this releases the flavour.\n\n2. Boil the kettle: It\u2019s important to pour the kettle the moment it finishes boiling, if you walk away you\u2019ll come back to a cooling kettle and that\u2019s not cool. If this does occur its better to use that water than to reboil as boiling again will boil off the oxygen. (See point 1).\n\n3. Add water: Pour the boiling water over the teabag and brew for 3 minutes, this gives the perfect amount of time to properly develop the flavour. It\u2019s best to just sit back and relax at this stage, don\u2019t shake or squeeze the bag, just be patient. For green tea you shouldn\u2019t brew for longer than 2 minutes because it gets bitter.\n\n4. Add milk: As odd as it sounds it is historically correct to pour the milk first, however it just makes more sense to us that it be added at this stage so you can adjust it to your liking.\n\n5. Add extra: Most tea purists frown upon adding sugar or honey but we\u2019re more interested in you enjoying your tea so as long as you\u2019ve followed the previous steps this can only add to your cuppa. If you\u2019re putting sugar in, be sure to use the same spoon for scooping sugar out of the jar and for stirring the tea. This brings good luck.",
